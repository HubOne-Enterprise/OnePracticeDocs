# Mail

Management of email messages has consistently been a difficult task. Ensuring emails and attachments to and from clients are saved and filed appropriately has commonly been the Achilles heel of many document management platforms.

HubOne solves this with Mail, a certified add-in to Microsoft Outlook which enables the rapid configuration, catalog and filing of emails directly to your document center. It also allows the user to assign metadata to the email before it is filed, and file in the root or subfolders beneath a clientâ€™s directory in SharePoint.

The following sections detail how to use Mail.

## Getting Started
On first run, you will be presented with the **Connect to Document Center** popup window

Enter your SharePoint Document Center URL which will be in a format like ```https://<designator>.sharepoint.com/documentcenter``` and enter your Office 365 login details.

Once done, click the **Connect** button to connect to SharePoint. This will run a one-off synchronisation process to retrieve your clients list.

Once the software has run its initial synchronisation each subsequent access should be faster as the software caches your list information on your own PC. 

> **Please note:** For this reason, when you add new clients to your clients list or if you add new folders or subfolders to SharePoint you will need to click the refresh button.

## The Controls
There are five controls available at the top of the application.

They are:

| Icon | Description |
| -- | -- |
| ![UpdateTheme](img/mail-updatetheme.PNG) | Update theme |
| ![Refresh](img/mail-refresh.PNG) | Refresh Clients & Folders |
| ![Connect](img/mail-connection.PNG) | Connect to Document Center |
| ![Settings](img/mail-settings.PNG) | Settings |
| ![Help](img/mail-help.PNG)| Help |

### Update theme
This button ensures the colors of Mail matches your Office 365 theme.

### Refresh Clients and folders
Synchronize the application with any changes to your clients' list or your folder structure in SharePoint.

### Connect to Document Center
Go here to enter your Office 365 credentials and your SharePoint Document Center site address.
